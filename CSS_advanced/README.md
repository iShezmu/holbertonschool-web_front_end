    - Based on `styles/1-style.css`, create the following declarations:

      - For all anchor elements, set the foreground color value to `#161616`
      - All elements with the class `visually-hidden` should have their display to `none`
      - All elements with the class `card-category`, should have their foreground color set to `#D73953`
